<h3><ins>Reflections on Industry Talk 2</ins></h3>

After listening to this talk, I am more knowledgable on the skills required in university and in the industry. 

The first speaker, Mr. Mohd Hakimi Iqmail gave us a talk about the basic skills required in computer science. I learnt that mastering the logic behind programming languages is more important than mastering a single language. Moreover, he mentioned that it was imperative that we have strong critical thinking and debugging skills.

The second speaker, Mr. Nik Mohd Habibullah bin Nik Mohd Nizam gave us a talk about the basic skills required when working in the industry. He gave us tips and guidelines when it comes to job hunting by using the IRPA method. Apart from that, he also talked about the important terms and software used for IT roles.

In conclusion, this talk gave me valuable insight on the skills that I need to improve on to succeed both academically and professionally. With their advices in mind, I can better identify my weakness and flaws and begin correcting them while I'm still in my first year.
